# SIMPLE COMMAND LINE APPLICATION TO RAINBOW-ISE TEXTUAL INPUT

the program in the main.go reads a text file and the outputs a colorful version of the content  
we pass the file by piping to the `go run main.go` command as shown(assume a text file called waterfall.txt):  
`cat waterfall.txt | go run main.go`

tested this out on an ubuntu system but you can use any piping implementations provided for your system
